End-to-End Data Processing Pipeline with Kafka, Airflow, and Spark

This project demonstrates a robust data processing pipeline that leverages the power of Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, and Apache Spark.
Key Components and Workflow:

1.	Data Generation:
  o	A Python script simulates real-time data generation and feeds it into a Kafka topic.
2.	Data Ingestion and Batch Processing with Airflow:
  o	An Airflow DAG orchestrates the following tasks: 
*	Kafka Message Collection: Collects a batch of 100 messages from the Kafka topic and stores them in a CSV file.
*	Data Cleaning: Reads the CSV file, cleans the data (e.g., handling missing values, converting to uppercase), and saves the cleaned data as a new CSV file.


Benefits of this Approach:
•	Scalability: Kafka's distributed architecture and Spark's parallel processing capabilities enable handling large volumes of data.
•	Reliability: Airflow ensures the reliability of the workflow by scheduling and monitoring tasks.
•	Flexibility: The pipeline can be easily adapted to different data sources, cleaning and transformation steps, and machine learning algorithms.
•	Real-time Insights: By leveraging Kafka's real-time streaming capabilities, the pipeline can provide timely insights.




To Run the Project:
1.	Set up the Environment:
  o	Ensure you have the necessary tools installed (Kafka, Airflow, Python, etc.).
  o	Configure the environment variables and properties files.
2.	Start Kafka:
  o	Start the Kafka broker and create the necessary topics.
3.	Run Airflow:
  o	Start the Airflow scheduler and web server.
4.	Execute the Pipeline:
  o	Trigger the Airflow DAG to initiate the data processing workflow.

By following these steps, you can effectively utilize this end-to-end data processing pipeline to extract valuable insights from your data.
